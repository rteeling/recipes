## Rob's No Corn Syrup Pecan Pie

### Ingredients

- 16 oz of halved pecans (chopped works too, its just less pretty)
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 3-4 Tbsp blackstrap molasses (substitute 1/4 cup regular molasses)
- 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp milk
- 1 Tsp valilla extract
- 1 Pie crust (Generally I use the Pillsbury premade pie crust you get in the cookie dough section)

### Procedure

1. Preheat oven to 325 F
2. (OPTIONAL) Set aside roughly 1/4 of the pecans. Pick the ones that are the least broken. These will be placed on top of the pie for a more appealing presentation.
3. Chop remaining pecans
4. Add thin coating of anti-stick spray to pie plate and line with crust, flute the outer edge of the crust as desired
5. Melt butter
6. In large mixing bowl, combine eggs and melted butter, beat until foamy (electric mixer reccomended)
7. Mix in both sugars and the flour, mix well
8. Mix in milk, vanilla extract and molasses. (OPTIONAL: Extra molasses may be used to acheive a more appealing color.)
9. Manually stir in chopped pecans, stir until nuts are fully coated
10. Transfer contents of mixing bowl to the pie crust
11. (OPTIONAL) Arrange pecan halves set aside on top of the pie for appealing presentation, round side down seems to work best, as the pecans will actually sink in the custard if put round side up
12. Bake for 35-45 minutes at 325 F. When done correctly the center of the pie will rise. The pie should be removed from the oven before it 'deflates', but a quick poke test can verify whether it is done. If the poke goes right in, it needs to cook longer, but if the pie offers some soft resistance it is done.
13. Let rest 24-48 hours in refrigerator prior to eating
